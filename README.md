# 5-LOX Structure and Pharmacophore Model

This repository contains:
- **6N2W_reconstructed.pdb**: A reconstructed and curated structure of the 5-lipoxygenase enzyme in complex with inhibitor NDGA (PDB ID: 6N2W).
- **5-LOX_pharmacophore_model.pmz**: A LigandScout-derived pharmacophore model highlighting features relevant for inhibitors with redox or chelating activity.

## Purpose
These resources are made publicly available to support virtual screening, docking, and pharmacophore-based discovery of new 5-LOX inhibitors.
